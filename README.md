# Crafting-interpreters

This repository contains the code I wrote while following the amazing book [Crafting Interpreters](https://timothya.com/pdfs/crafting-interpreters.pdf).

As the book is divided into 2 parts, so is this repository. The first part is the implementation of the Lox language in Java, and the second part is the implementation of the Lox language in C.
